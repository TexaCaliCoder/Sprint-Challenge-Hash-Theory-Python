2. What is an array and how does it work?

An array is  container that holds a fixed number of items by allotting a specific block of memory to store these items in sequence. Many languages make it very easy to allocate additional memory when the array size exceeds its current capacity. When this happens the array will then need to create a new block of memory and transfer the existing data to the new array and destroy the old pointer.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

Hashtables are a data structure used to store information by hashing the index or "key" which makes accessing the data faster because you do not need to loop through an array you can access the data directly from the hash or key as used in a dictionary. In addition by adding a linked node you can prevent having to resize the table by linking it to an existing hash.
